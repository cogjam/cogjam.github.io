				<h2>Personal information</h2>
			</header>
			<p>My name is Alex [redacted], and I am a student at RMIT (student number: s3775643). My student email address is s3775643@student.rmit.edu.au.</p>
			<p>I was born in the UK and have lived in Australia for about 8 years. My only verbal language is English, and my highest academic qualification is at Cert IV level.</p>
			<p>I am passionate about many things with not one taking precedent. I play ice hockey and have two children.</p>

				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			</header>
					<p>I have significant interest in IT. The potentiality excites me, and motivates much of my effort to work within the field, and it's presence throughout our lives is something I am constantly thinking about and contextualising against all other system of human interrelation.</p>
					<p>My interest in IT started when I was about 11 years old and got my first PC. I have always been interested in exploring systems and understanding the function (and customisation-capacity) of each function.</p>
					<p>I haven't had paid employment within a IT role, only in either hobbyist or pro-bono capacities. I currently serve as the treasurer for a housing cooperative, a role that requires developing and maintaining financing systems for a medium-size organisation.</p>
					<p>I choose to study at RMIT (through OUA) because of the course specifications being aligned to my interests, availability and work-outcome expectations.</p>
					<p>During my studies I expect to learn enough to secure me a entry-level role within an organisation, working on or developing IT systems. I expect to have a generalist understanding of existing and emerging technologies, that will allow me to intersect with my specific tools later on.</p>

<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38472114?type=standard&searchrequesttoken=d45eb6b3-5883-4da5-b78e-13c8e8482892">SQL Analyst</a></p>
<p>The role of SQL Analyst for a education client requires someone to process and migrate data from a legacy system. This work will largely require the applicant to use SQL scripts and process data using MACROS within MS Excel, along with other tasks such as production of reports and user account creation/management. </p>
			<p>The role is appealing to me because of its finite nature and problem-solving scope. The challenge of bridging between the old and new, and supporting the transition, both technically and for personnel is something I can imagine myself excelling at.</p>
			<p>The role requires someone that has a proven-history with developping SQL scripts, and working within controlled IT systems. Along with the ability to work directly with stakeholders, to uncover and address needs.</p>
			<p>The position description to not state a preference for qualification, or experience in terms of years.</p>
			<p>I currently have a great deal of experience related to communication with stakeholders, and could sufficiently demonstrate this aspect for the SQL Analyst role. I do not however have any experience with SQL, or any database systems. The experience I have within IT is limited to front-end web development and low-level IT systems management.</p>
			<p>To bridge the skill gap, and become eligible for the above position, I would need to learn about databases in general, and specifically SQL. I would be required to learn how to analyse and present data, at the conceptual level, and in terms of technologies (SQL queries, MACROS) and and business operations. The skill gap is large, but I expect attainable within a 5 year time-frame.</p>

				<h2>Personal Profile</h2>

			<p>The results for my online aptitude tests are as follows:</p>
<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test</a>: Mediator (INFP-a)</p>
<a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=3&V=11&T=6">Learning Style test</a>: Auditory: 15%, Visual: 55%, Tactile: 30%</p>
			<a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/creativity-quiz.htm">Creativity Quiz</a>: Score 66/80 (Preperation: 21/25, Incubation: 9/10, Insight: 15/15, Evaluation: 9/15, Implementation: 12/15)</p>
			<p>The results from the tests taken do align with previously held notions about myself. The Myers-Briggs result of INFP aligns with my image of being someone who is passionate, open-minded, creative and hardworking, yet idealistic, occasionally impractical, and difficult to get to know. The Learning Style test, showing me to be a visual learner rings-true in my perception of how I engage with content/issues. And the Creativity test, scoring highly generally, matches my understanding of myself as someone who excels in areas of insight and ideation, but is average in implementation and evaluation.</p>
			<p>The results could influence my behavior in a team by allowing myself to specialise or limit my activity to only a select few stages of production. For example, seeing how I excel at ideation, and score highly on empathy and communication, there may be value to me being predominantly situated within development settings rather than debugging or testing, for example.</p>
			<p>When forming a new team it is valuable to know what resources are at hand (people in this case), and to deploy them wisely. Knowing what a person excels at allows team to put the best people into specific roles, and also allows for the opportunity to ensure all areas of a project are covered by someone who feels at home within that space.</p>

				<h2>Project Idea</h2>
			</header>	
	
			<p>My project, OWNED, will be a responsive web-app built built for the skateboarding community globally. The web-app will be map-based and let skaters compete for 'best trick at spot' by having footage of their trick voted on by users. The app will require a back-end database and front-end user interface. The interface will allow users to add links to videos for locations, and will let viewers browse a map to see tricks at different skating spots. When viewing a location, users can vote on tricks, and videos will be ranked according to community votes.</p>
			<p>The web-app will be useful for the skateboarding community as it will allow them to discover new good spots for skating, and for seeing different features within spots that they may not have considered using before. The app will be interesting to users as it will allow them to watch videos of the locations they may know, and will facilitate local and global rivalry.</p>
			<p>The app will be a web-based responsive app primarily centered around a map interface with embedded videos and voting buttons. It will be a mobile-first experience as many users (primarily teenagers) will be using the app on their phones, with peers, at skating locations.</p>
			<p>The users will not need to register or log-in to vote, rather to restrict voting to one vote per spot, the app will reference the users IP to a database.</p>
			<p>The app will be built on a database that stores information such as the coordinates of a spot, links to uploaded videos, and votes on videos. At this stage, for the app there will be no options for users to add comments to videos, except from directly on the linked YouTube video itself.</p>
			<p>The web-app will be built using Webflow, a web-based WYSIWYG front-end development tool, and MapBox, a mapping api. Data will be stored using Airtable, a web-based database tool, and referenced using Integromat, a tool that provides a visual interface for working with APIs.</p>
			<p>The purpose for using propitiatory tools as mentioned is that of building the app using a Minimum Viable Product MVP methodology. Building a MVP will allow me to develop a product quickly (days instead of weeks or months) and will let me see which features (if any) users appreciate before investing heavily into their production.</p>
			<p>The web-app will require a good understanding of working with all the tools outlined above (Webflow, MapBox, Airtable and Integromat), so will need the development team to understand basic front-end web-development skills (HTML and CSS), basic mapping concepts (how coordinates are referenced and called, how MapBox renders mapping layers etc.) and how the API integration works with a tool such as Integromat.</p>
			<p>If this product is successful it will allow skateboarders to have an additional connection with their local skateboarding environment, and it's community. The app will encourage skateboarders to reconsider their built environment, and see new spots in their cities/towns. The app will serve to bring together potentially isolated young people, as it will encourage users to return to a spot many times to master a trick to 'OWN' that location. A battle over a spot would likely have two or more people returning often to 'RECLAIM' the spot, and like common in skateboarding, would foster close social connection over friendly rivalry.</p>
